## Description 

With countless movies spread across different streaming services and
platforms, it‚Äôs challenging for users to find accurate and complete
information about what they want to watch. Often, the information is
scattered across various sites, making it hard to get a full picture of what a
movie or show is about. Existing platforms usually have fragmented data,
limited ways to discover new content, and can be frustrating to navigate. To
address this, we need to create a single, easy-to-use¬†website.
